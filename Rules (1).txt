* Players
* 1 player
* Deck
* A standard 52-card deck.
* Goal
* Build all four suits up from ace to king in separate piles.
* Setup
* Shuffle the deck.
* Deal out 28 cards into seven piles, in the following manner: The first pile (left to right) includes one card, the second pile includes two cards, the third pile includes three cards, etc., so that the last pile has seven cards.
* This array is known as the tableau.
* Turn the top card on each pile face up, so that there are 7 face-up cards.
* Set the remaining cards aside, forming a draw pile.
* Foundations
* As they become available, the four aces must be played above the tableau; these are the four foundations. Cards of the same suit may be played on each ace in ascending order, from low (2) to high (king).
* Once a card is played on a foundation, it can't be removed.
* Playing on the Tableau
* On the tableau, cards are played in descending order, alternating colors. Always plays cards on the tableau so that every card below it remains partially visible, so that you can tell which cards are in the column.
* EXAMPLE: The 10 of hearts may be played on either the Jack of clubs or the Jack of spades. The 5 of clubs may be played on either the 6 of hearts or 6 of diamonds.
* Anytime you move a card from one pile of the tableau to another, turn the revealed face-down card face up. This card is now available to be played or to be played on.
* If a column in the tableau is emptied, any visible king (or a visible king with other cards on top of it) can be moved to fill that space.
* Gameplay
* Turn cards from the draw pile over one at a time until there’s three. If the card you turn over on top is playable (either on a foundation or on the tableau), you may do so. If not, add it to a face-up discard pile. The top card on the discard pile is always available to be played.
* You may only go through the draw pile as many times as it takes to win. 
* Winning
* You win Klondike Solitaire by building all four suits up from ace to king.
