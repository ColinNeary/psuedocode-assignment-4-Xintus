//Card game isn't named in title.txt and I have no idea what game this is, so I can't really help out with instructions
 //and all of the astrisks ironically make the text harder to follow
 Turn 1:
   //Define how many cards each player gets and etc
   Deal the cards

    //formatting
     Look over all the cards on the field:
        if there are any aces: 
          then move to the delegated pile on the side and look at flipped over cards
      
       If any face up in the piles can be put on top of aces in sequential ascending order that also has the same suit:
                then move

        //Instead of putting () try to define what you mean
         If you can move cards between piles (moving to pile must be in descending order and must be alternating in color (i.e. black            then red/red then black):
           then move any available cards from one pile to another:
            If there is a card under the card you move:
               then flip over the new card and see if any moves may be made to piles (same rules apply)
      
           If any cards can be put on top of the foundations in sequential order with same suit or aces can start a foundation:
            then move to foundations:
               else : next step
    
             If you have any kings face up:
                //Could add something better than a comma to define
                then open pile = true, move to open pile:
                   If move was from a pile:
                    then flip over the card that was below the king:
                    //Repeat until?
                        Repeat all previous processes
           
               If preceding moves can be repeated:
                  then continue to move until no more moves are possible
   
                 Flip over 3 cards from the top of the deck one at a time:
                    If there are less than 3 cards: 
                      then deal as many as you can
     
                   Look at the top card:
                      If the first card can be put on top of a foundation or start a foundation with an ace (Must be sequential and same                       suite):
                        then move
                      If card can be moved to a pile:
                         then moving to pile must be in descending order and must be alternating in color (i.e. black then red/red then                          black):
                           If moved: 
                             then check if the second card flipped over can be moved:
                              Check for possible repeated moves:
                     else : check if first card is a king:
                        If king: 
                          then check if you can place it on an open pile:
                           If open pile = true:
                             then move it there:
                               else : skip:
                                  Check for possible repeated moves
                
                       If first card is moved, check second face-up card:
                           Repeat previous process;
                             If second card is moved = true:
                               Check if third card can be moved:
                                If true:
                                 then repeat
              
                      If there are leftover cards (i.e. first flipped, second, or third flipped weren’t moved ):
                          then place them to the bottom of the deck
   
                         If you can move cards between piles (moving to pile must be in descending order and must be alternating in                              color (i.e. black then red/red then black):
                          then move any available cards from one pile to another:
                           If there is a card under the card you move:
                            then flip over the new card and see if any moves may be made to piles (same rules apply)
        
                         If any cards can be put on top of the foundations in sequential order with same suite or aces can start a                                foundation:
                          then move to foundations:
                             else : next step
      
                           If you have any kings face up:
                              then open pile = true, move to open pile: 
                                 If move was from a pile:
                                   then flip over the card that was below the king:
                                     Repeat all previous processes
           
                             If preceding moves can be repeated:
                               then continue to move until no more moves are possible
   
                               When complete, turn over

                                  If all of pile’s cards are flipped over twice with no cards moved:
                                   then the game is over
   
Turn 2: Repeat Turn 1 process

Turn 3: Repeat Turn 1 process
